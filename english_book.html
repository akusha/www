        <font size="+2">    
        <p align ="left">First, I want to tell you about myself. 
        I am thirteen and I am in the third form at school in Manchester. 
        I have a little sister Bess who is very silly and I have a very clever dog. His name is Pal</p>
        <p>What a bad day Monday was for me! I woke up late and did not have time to eat me breakfast. 
        I did not see my books and my school cap in their places. I looked in my room. I looked in the dining-room. 
        Then I looked into the bathroom and saw my books there. Then I saw my dog Pal under the table with my cap. 
        I put my books into my bag, took my cap and ran very <b>quicly</b> to schol.</p>
        <p>The first lesson on Monday is <b>maths</b>. What a difficult <b>subject</b> to begin the week with! Mr.Green,
        the mathematics teacher, took our homework. He saw that my exercise book was <b>dirty</b>. He given me a bad mark for it.
        Then he gave us <b>tasks</b> to do. I sit <b>behind</b> Jane, who is <b>fat</b> and <b>silly</b>. 
        But she likes <b>maths</b> very much and has good narks for it. I asked her to tell me the answers, but she didn't want to.</p>
        <p>The second lesson on Monday is French. I like Franch. It's nice to talk to yuor frends at the lesson in <b>another</b> language. 
            Then it was eleven o'clock - time for <b>break</b>. Nell gave me a <b>piece</b> of cake to eat with my milk and then gave me her 
            homework to <b>copy</b>. I think Nell likes me, and she is a nice girl.</p>
        <p>After <b>break</b> we had two lesson in Latin! They are bad lessons. I do not like Latin. </p>
